        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            I was craving Spam musubi. Without a musubi maker/rice press, I improvised with this deconstructed version.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup lite soy sauce </li>
            <li>¼ cup oyster sauce </li>
            <li>2 (12 ounce) cans low-sodium canned luncheon meat (such as SPAM®), cut into 1/2-inch cubes </li>
            <li>2 ½ cups water </li>
            <li>2 cups medium-grain white rice (such as Calrose) </li>
            <li>6 tablespoons rice vinegar </li>
            <li>1 (1.2 ounce) package roasted and seasoned seaweed, torn into 1 1/2-inch pieces </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix sugar, soy sauce, and oyster sauce together in a resealable gallon-size bag. Add luncheon meat, seal bag, and turn to coat, gently squeezing to coat luncheon meat. Marinate for at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Bring water to a boil; add rice. Return water to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat; add luncheon meat and marinade. Cook, stirring frequently, until luncheon meat is browned and marinade is absorbed, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir rice vinegar into rice until combined.</li>
            <li>Stir rice and seaweed together in a bowl; add luncheon meat and mix well.</li>
        </ol>
